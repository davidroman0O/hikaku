`hikaku` is a toolbox for types that intent to enhance your knowledge of the types at runtime

# todos and ideas

- struct to map[string]interface{}
- map[string]inteface{} to struct
- T to map[string]interface{}
- map[string]inteface{} to T
- fuck inventing new terminology, i will use re-use `go` terms to extra the structure of what `hikaku` analyze
- i need flat and unflat representation of the nested structs
- i need merging differences + flat version
- i need resolutions differences
